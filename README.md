# DL_ASSGNMENT

Overview
This repository contains code for data augmentation, a technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data. Data augmentation is commonly used in machine learning and computer vision tasks to improve the generalization of models.


Introduction
Explain the purpose of data augmentation and how it contributes to the success of machine learning models. Include information on why data augmentation is important, and how it helps in training robust and generalized models.

Requirements
List the software and hardware requirements for using the data augmentation code. Include any dependencies or libraries that need to be installed.
